# Professional Ambitions and Learning Goals

During my internship, I discovered the world of Serious Gaming and Game-Based Learning. I realised that (video) games can be useful tools to teach new skills to people. I also learnt that the entire branch of video games, Edutainment, is woefully underdeveloped, leading to very school-sy, low fidelity, and -dare I say it- BORING games. If you give a child the choice between playing Apple Counter and Pokémon, they'll probably choose Pokémon. Because Pokémon is fun.

I want to change that.

A good edutainment game should foremost be a fun game.





I want to improve my level design skills, so I can create maps that encourage exploration and puzzle-solving

I want to show that gameplay elements of one genre can be applied to another

I want to teach players without explaining in words
