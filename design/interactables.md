# Interactables

When you explore a level, there are various objects you can interact with. I group these under the name "Interactables". These range from Doors, to Switches, Levers and Buttons, to Ladders and Stairs, to Items you can pick up, or the rare NPC.

Doors impede your movement, and obscure your view of the area behind them. They can be locked, opened remotely, or they open only from one side. Sometimes the door controls might be broken, and you will need to find another way to get around. Or through.

It's floor-based cousin is the Trapdoor. These are almost always triggered remotely, and they open holes in the floor or ceiling. If there is an unfortunate entity standing on them, which might be you, they will fall down when the trapdoor is opened. Unless they fly, of course.

Switches and Levers are similar, in that they trigger other interactables according to their state. They're either on or off, and so is the object they're linked too. On the contrary, a button will always do something when activated, and it's up to the linked object what to do with the signal.

Ladders and Stairs let you change your elevation. Ladders send you straight up or down, Stairs do so at an incline.

From The Reservoir, we take Valves. Valves control the water level in an area. You can either open a Valve, increasing the water level, or close and lower the water level. For extended details on how water works in the game, please see "Water and Ice".

Item pickups grant you an immediate effect when interacted with. You can get healed, refueled, restocked, or you find a new upgrade.

You can talk to NPCs, who can give you valuable hints, or more information about the world you're on. These are few. In fact, they only exist at the surface.
