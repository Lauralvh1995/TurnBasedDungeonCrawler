# Water and Ice

One central element taken from the Reservoir, is Water. In both liquid and solid forms. In the Reservoir, you had to raise the water level, so you could create bridges at the correct height and get across.

Water is confined to an area and has its level controlled by Valves. The player can stay underwater indefinitely, as their suit provides oxygen and withstands increased pressure. If you were to fall into it, it will break your fall and you take no damage.

But water can be a hazard too. If there is an exposed source of electricity in the water, the entire volume is electrified, and will hurt you at the start of each turn.

On the surface of water, you can use the Ice Beam to create Ice Tiles. These Ice Tiles last until something heavy steps on top of them, or until the volume they're on changes. The player is considered heavy. The moment something heavy steps on them, they have one turn to get to solid ground. The Ice Tile breaks afterwards.



Water and Ice stemmed from the desire to have a form of verticality in the game that isn't completely tied to stairs and ladders. But since the player is not able to jump, a different idea is needed. Temporary bridges are a fun way.
