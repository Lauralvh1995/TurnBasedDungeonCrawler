# Gameplay

How this game is played, is derived form the dungeon crawlers I've marked as my inspiration.

The game is played in a first-person perspective, with the following controls (on XBOX controller):

* UP: move forward
* DOWN: move backward
* LEFT: turn left
* RIGHT: turn right
* LB: strafe left
* RB: strafe right
* X: use melee weapon
* Y: use ranged weapon
* A: interact
* B: wait
* Home/Start: open menu
* Back/Select: open map
* L-Stick up/down: cycle up/down through possible interactables
* Press R-Stick: toggle Freelook mode
* LT: change melee weapon
* RT: change ranged weapon

While you're in Freelook mode, you can't move, attack or interact. You can look around by moving the Left analog stick.

Each action besides turning on the spot, opening menus, cycling through interactables, or using Freelook mode, takes a turn.
