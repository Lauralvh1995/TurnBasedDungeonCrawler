# Story, Lore and Worldbuilding

"_You are the greatest treasure hunter in the galaxy, and youâ€™ve set your sights on the treasures buried on the abandoned planet of Xoth VI. As the stories go, Xoth VI was the home planet of a mysterious and highly advanced species called the Vernaxx. You delve into places neither mankind nor the Vernaxx have been for ages. But delve too deep, and you might find out why the Vernaxx abandoned their home in the first place._

In _Lost Treasures of Xoth VI_ the player is a treasure hunter. They search for treasure in the ruins on Xoth VI, solving puzzles and defeating pesky guardians on the way. During their journey, they encounter problems and find new tools to help them out. They forge their own paths to their goals. But the ruins of Xoth VI are treacherous, and the player needs to think about every move they make. The Vernaxx left traps and guardians behind to make sure whatever they are guarding stays hidden."

Reading this blurb will leave you with some questions: What or where is Xoth VI? Who are the Vernaxx? And why did they abandon their home?

I've created only a small part of the whole game as a demo. Here you will not really interact with the story of the game. It wouldn't make sense to drop the player right into the middle of it.

The story for the full game would go as follows:&#x20;

You touch down on Xoth VI, after carefully scanning the planet for life forms. You have your goal: a big vault at the core of the planet. Unbeknownst to you, you're followed by Space Pirates. When you reach the vault, in a cutscene, the pirate leader teleports in and thanks you for all the hard work, but the treasure will be his.

Then the treasure breaks out of the vault. A big monster chases you back to the surface. Data suggests that the monster was locked away for very good reasons. You strike a deal with the Pirates, and you venture deeper into the ruins to find out more about the monster, why it was created, and most importantly, how can it be stopped.



How will you interact with the story and world in the game?

The monster will run around in the ruins, and you will know when it's near. The ruins of Xoth VI all tell a story. You learn details about Vernaxx society. You also learn that these parts are all part of a bio-research lab. A fringe-group of warmongers set out to create incredible bioweapons and take over the galaxy. Their efforts went unnoticed until it almost was too late. The Vernaxx Leaders ordered all created monsters to be sealed away in the lab and executed the creators. Then everyone else was to abandon the planet.



Other tidbits:

Xoth VI, as the name suggests, is the 6th planet circling around the star Xoth. Xoth is named after the chief deity of the Vernaxx. All planets in the system have a proper name, but since the Vernaxx have disappeared, the Federation only uses the systemic names. You can learn these names from bits of fluff spread through the game.

Vernaxx are a reptilian species. They can be compared to both crocodiles and snakes in part of their physiology. They also sport a colorful coat of feathers on parts of their bodies.
