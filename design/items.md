# Items

A metroidvania character needs a bunch of items at their disposal. These items are the keys to the locks the world presents to you. Actually, most items are weapons. Most weapons have a function beyond destroying enemies. The only items that aren't weapons are resource upgrades, or the Jetpack.

Health, Ammo and Fuel upgrades all increase your resources.

The Jetpack is a mid-to-late game item. It comes with 5 units of Fuel. The Jetpack allows you to fly in the air, but only for the amount of turns you have fuel for. It recharges when you stand on the ground. If you run out of fuel mid-air, you fall down.

Next up are the weapons. These are mostly inspired by their counterparts from Metroid, with one exception.

Then you have your basic melee weapon, which I envisioned as a slightly sturdier glove. You punch things with it. It doesn't do anything else.

The basic ranged weapon is similar. It shoots a pellet of energy up to 3 tiles away. You can trigger buttons from a distance, or at least something that needs to be pushed.

A bit of an upgrade would be the Missile. You shoot a missile, which consumes 1 ammo, and it explodes in a 1 tile "circle" upon impact, or when it reaches its maximum distance of 3 tiles. This one can also remotely trigger buttons, switches or levers, as long as you need to push it.

The Ice Beam is the one item that is implemented besides the basic attacks. You can use it to freeze enemies solid and turn them into obstacles. This is only temporary, but it can buy you valuable turns to get your bearings. You can also use it to freeze water and create temporary bridges. The exact details about how Ice Tiles work are in the upcoming chapter

The next two items are mirrors of each other, but one is melee, the other ranged.

The Grapple Beam can pull things towards you, from up to 3 tiles away. You can use it to move boxes, pull enemies out of hiding, or you can pull levers you can't reach normally. I'm still not sure if I would allow it to pull you towards its target, if it isn't movable. This is still a consideration for the future.

The Power Glove is the melee counterpart. This one is inspired by the Zelda series. You can punch things with it and push them up to 3 tiles away. You can also use it to break open jammed doors. All other breakable things are just stationary enemies in disguise.
