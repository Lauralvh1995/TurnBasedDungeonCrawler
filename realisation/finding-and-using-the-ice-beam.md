# Finding and Using the Ice Beam

To guide the player to the Ice Beam, and then later also using it, I've employed the techniques of Anticipation, a "noob bridge" and Environmental Storytelling.

During gameplay, you come across this broken Emergency Cabinet

![Captain Obvious says that it's indeed a Broken Emergency Cabinet](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

That means that someone used to be here, and whatever was in that cabinet was taken. This is a point of anticipation.

Following the path along, you come across this scene

![You're standing on a ledge, and there's ice on the water. What will you do?](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Here the player is informed that water can be frozen to create a bridge. There is also a very clear point of interest across the water. It looks like a dead person, and they have something lying next to them.

The player can walk across, where they will learn that Ice will break under weight, closing the path behind them. Should the player step back, they can still reach the other side via the ladder. However, there is still no way back.

![Alas, poor Vernaxx- wait, we already did that joke.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

The dead person of interest has something with them: The Ice Beam. This is the key the player is supposed to find. A keen player can have figured out that the dead NPC has used this item to get to the position, and fire it across the water to create a new bridge.

A not so keen player will think they're now locked up and try to shoot and interact with everything. By trial and error, they can create their path forward (actually, backward, but that's backtracking for you). The instructions are given by a combination of a demonstrating NPC, and forcing the player to use it to get back to where they were.

The player is now informed about the usage of the Ice Beam, and can now combine it with changing water levels to create paths to locations they couldn't reach before.
