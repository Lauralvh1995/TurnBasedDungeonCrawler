# Play-Testing at Night of the Nerds

I play-tested the Complete Level at Night of the Nerds.

I have learnt a great deal from these play-tests. Common feedback was that the game was too dark, making everything hard to see. That has since been adjusted, and now you can see more.

Another thing that stuck out was that it wasn't very clear to players what they should do, where they should go, or even what they _can_ do. Some players even forgot they picked up a new item. Here I realised that maybe complete non-verbal communication isn't the way to go. I've added text pop-ups for when you start and end the demo, find a new item, or when a door is locked.

Opinions on the map and mini-map are mixed. Some thought they were helpful, others thought they were only confusing. I had one player even tell me they thought the map was too helpful.

The last thing, which I'm still planning to fix for the final version, is making it clear something can be interacted with. This is such an essential thing that I should chastise myself for forgetting about it.

Some other feedback I got, I thought I should take with a grain of salt. First-Person Turn-Based Dungeon Crawler is a retro genre, and the highschoolers weren't used to it.

I had one person ragequit the game, which was pretty sad. They didn't even tell me why they thought it was too hard.

Besides collecting verbal feedback, I also observed whether the players went to the Small Channel first, or first went through the door. This is because I want players to actually visit the points of anticipation I spread through the level, instead of them wandering off and losing track of what to do. The spread was about 50/50. There is a colleration between players who got lost, and those who went through the door first. I cannot say for sure if that is also the cause.

All in all, I thought the play-test was useful, and it taught me a lot of things about my game I didn't know yet.
