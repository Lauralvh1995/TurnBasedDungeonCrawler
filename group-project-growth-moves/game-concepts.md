# Game Concepts

We designed a few games to play with the Picoo. These games mix practice of school subjects with fun gameplay. I personally worked on the concepts of Simon Says, Bop-It! and Capture the Flag/Living Stratego.

Besides that, I made the visualisation for Capture the Flag

Each game has been discussed with PABO students, one of Picoo's developers, and the product owner. They were very enthusiastic and gave us great insight in how the games would be used in practice.



I also made some doodles on how the concept for Red Light, Green Light could be expanded, but that would require extra hardware which we didn't have, and was dismissed right after.
