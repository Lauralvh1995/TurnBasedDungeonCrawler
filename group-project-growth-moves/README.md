# Group Project - Growth Moves

Growth Moves is a project that aims to combine exercise with education for primary school children. Research has shown that the brain is more receptive to learning when the body is exercising.

The project owner asked us to design games that focus on object-control and balance when it comes to movement. They backed this up with studies that show that these skills are lacking more and more in children aged between 6 and 10.

For the learning aspect, they aim to use this for automatisation of knowledge.

Our implementation aims to use Picoo and SmartClips.
