# Personas

To explore the needs of our various users, I created two personas. One for the teacher and one for a child.

A persona is a semi-fictional character based on your ideal intended user. These are useful because they give a name and a face to your user, who might otherwise be kind of nebulous. They have goals they want to achieve, by using the product, and there are barriers that prevent them from using it.

At first, I described them around the idea I had about how teachers and children act, based on my experiences. However, this didn't work out well.&#x20;

Further research indicates that the best way to create a persona is to poll your intended userbase and base the personas on those results. By the time I encountered this, we had already moved on to creating the games, and I felt my energy was best used elsewhere.
