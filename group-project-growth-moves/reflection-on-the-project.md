# Reflection on the project

During the project, I felt like I could do more. When I compare the amount of work I've done for the project to that of the others, I feel like I barely did any work.

This is compounded by a general feeling of not enjoying the project. The project was challenging, which is a good thing, but not when combined with stakeholders who have varying ideas of what the project should be. As an autistic person, this hits hard. My head can't handle conflicting information that well. Whenever we asked a stakeholder for info, they tried to pull us in a wildly different direction.

Then there is the setbacks. When Picoo told us that we couldn't use their SDK for development, we were disappointed. They didn't want us to use their propietary software, which is their right, but that closes down the opportunity for people to use their platform in projects like these.

The moment we could turn our focus to realisation, things went better. But it was relatively late in the project that we realised that we were the ones that made the choices, NOT our stakeholders. The meeting with Michael about this hurt, but it was the wake-up call we needed. We didn't need to deliver a nice, finished, package. We can't go through the whole process of developing a product, which usually takes years, in 9 weeks.

All in all, I think we delivered a great starting point for an internship to continue.
