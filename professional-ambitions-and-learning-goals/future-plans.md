# Future Plans

In the future, I want to expand the game into a full fledged game. That means multiple areas to explore, more items to discover and actual enemies to fight.

I have set up the basics for enemies to function, but they do not have any AI elements yet. That would be one of the bigger priorities. Right now, the only "enemies" in the game are breakable boxes. Those don't need any AI to function, because they don't do anything.

The big enemy would either need a complex AI, or it would be heavily scripted.

The game world right now is small. It's only a small part of a water treatment facility. The whole facility is a lot bigger than this, and it's not the only point of interest on Xoth VI.

Besides that, the game is still made with mostly basic shapes in Unity. The graphics need a complete overhaul.

I also haven't put any work into sound design and music. Those are also clear points where the game can get an upgrade.
