# Inspiration

This project started with the idea: What if Metroid was a grid-based dungeon crawler?

Games for inspiration:\
Wizardry

Etrian Odyssey

Legend of Grimrock II

Vaporum

Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon

Metroid Prime

Super Metroid

Elements I want to use:

* Metroid:&#x20;
  * Progression locked behind upgrades
  * Non-linear level design
* Dungeon Crawlers:&#x20;
  * Tactical combat
  * Turn-based or Realtime combat
  * Exploration
  * Grid-based movement

What can I learn from these games: Level design, puzzle design, enemy design, UI design
