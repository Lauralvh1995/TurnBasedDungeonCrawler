# Visiting SPIEL '21

Besides my love for (making) video games, I also like to play board games. On 17-10-2021, I visited SPIEL in Essen (Germany). SPIEL is the largest board game convention in the world. Over four days, board game developers, publishers and traders from all over the world offer their product to play and buy. Sometimes you even get to talk to one of the big brains behind them. (I just missed Richard Garfield a few years ago, that was a bummer)

What is probably the most interesting part, is the hall full of independent developers who are there to gauge interest, play-test and seek funding for their project. Here you almost get a direct look into the kitchen of what could be the next Settlers of Catan in terms of popularity.

In line with my education, I have play-tested several of these works in progress. I have shared my insights, they shared theirs, and I've left them some valuable feedback. I even got a bottle of water and a piece of promotional art for my troubles.

All in all, SPIEL was a fun, interesting, slightly educational and a bit exhausting experience.



It's smaller, Dutch cousin, Spellenspektakel will take place at the 6th and 7th of November in Utrecht.
