# Environmental Storytelling

Environmental storytelling is all about non-verbal communication. You try to communicate to the player something happened through careful arrangements of a location and props within that location. This is particularly useful when you don't have many NPCs running around to give you exposition. Either because those NPCs are hostile, or, because they are long gone.

Bethesda Softworks does this really well in both the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls series.

Say, you want to communicate to the player and old and powerful ruler once lived in the castle. You can put portraits of them on the walls, but that's cheating a tiny bit. No, you make sure to display his glory through luxury materials, statues and whatever you can think of. Though you must also make it look like no-one has been here for years, the lack of maintenance is going to add up.

The interesting part is where you can use this kind of communication to inform the player about what they should do. I remember a _Dungeons and Dragons_ game I wrote, where the players could only damage a boss if they checked the boss according to chess rules. To communicate which class corresponds to which chess piece, I arranged miniatures in the correct configurations. In-game, those miniatures represented statues. The boss was on a raised platform, conveniently 8x8 squares in size. The players accomplished their goal through sheer coincidence, in the end. They only noticed what was up after the fact.

This example highlights a risk to all environmental storytelling: It's open to interpretation. And players can (wilfully) ignore it.
