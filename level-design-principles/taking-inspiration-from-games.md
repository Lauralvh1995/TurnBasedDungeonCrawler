# Taking Inspiration From Games

To understand the game genres I'm trying to combine, I first should play a few examples. For this I've played through Super Metroid (emulated on PC, with gamepad) and Etrian Odyssey (DS game played on 3DS).

Super Metroid is the third mainline installment in the Metroid series by Nintendo, from 1994. This is the game that defined the first half of the Metroidvania genre. The -vania half was added by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which added RPG elements into the mix.

What I've learned from Super Metroid is that games at some point start to show their age in not a good way. It's a great game, great atmosphere, great platforming and good non-verbal communication besides telling you what button (combination) activates your newest toy. But the controls show it's age (it's older than me!). Switching between your normal beam and the various missiles, power bomb, grappl_ing_ beam (it was still called grappling beam at the time, not grapple beam like nowadays) and the x-ray scope is slow. You could only cycle in one direction: it's always Missile -> Super Missle -> Power Bomb -> Grappling Beam -> X-Ray Scope -> None. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game to play, but later installments control a lot better.

I want to adopt mostly the atmosphere and world-building of Metroid. The variety of weapons is fun, but switching between them has to be easier. The player shouldn't get frustrated at trying to switch their weapon. I am not going to make a platformer, so I didn't look at the floaty physics.

Etrian Odyssey is a completely different beast. Etrian Odyssey is a more modern take of the first-person dungeon crawler made by Atlus. The genre died down in the west around the turn of the millennium, but it's still hugely popular in Japan. To the point that most major turn-based JRPGs are adopting elements from it.

The game starts you off by creating an adventurer's guild and your first set of characters. Then you talk to some people and off you go into the dungeon. You walk around on a grid, trying to find your way and drawing a map on the touch screen as you go. The random battles are brutal and you might find yourself dragging dead party members back to town to resurrect them soon. Besides the random battles, which are predicted by a circle slowly turning red in the corner of the screen, you also have to watch out for FOEs. FOEs are big, overpowered, enemies represented by orange balls on the overworld. They patrol, or chase you, on the map and make one move for each move you make. The random battle predictor also has a gauge for how close a FOE is. FOEs will keep moving even when you are stuck in a random battle. They will even butt in on your current battle, should you be fighting when they get to you.

The controls are simple, you navigate the map with the d-pad, where the up and down button will move you one square in the direction you're facing (away from), and the left and right button change the direction you're facing. The game lacks any kind of strafing, where you move left or right, but keep facing forward. Battles are played out in a pretty standard menu-based system. You have 5 party members, in a 3-2 or 2-3 formation. Front row takes more damage, but will also dish out more. Opposite for the back row, unless you use a ranged weapon or magic.

I will take the movement system and add in strafing. I don't want combat to take place in a separate screen. Each enemy will be visible in the overworld, much like a FOE. This also means you don't have to engage, if you don't want to.
