# Analysis

Before I can properly design the game I want to make, I first need to analyse concepts used in the games I chose as my inspiration. I also look at two of the games I chose for inspiration in more detail. Discussing the gameplay elements that stood out to me, and I want to use in my game.

As I'm trying to create a metroidvania in a turn-based setting, I first look at the concepts used in Super Metroid. These are Anticipation (or Foreshadowing), Lock-And-Key, and Experience, "Don't Tell"

Besides that, I've taken a look at Environmental Storytelling, as I want to minimize the amount of words needed to communicate information to the player.
