**Metroidvania level design**

_Anticipation_

Purposely letting the player encounter problems, they cannot solve yet. Specifically combined with the lock-and-key principle, introducing the lock before the key. This will make the player search for a key that can open the lock. This will help them look for a type of key even if they do not know the specific key. For example, a red lock will have players anticipate a red key.



_Lock-And-Key_

When the player is confronted with a metaphorical lock, they will need to find the corresponding key to progress. This key can be an item, a tool, a literal key, or even knowledge about the game’s systems. The latter brings the infamous “Noob Bridge” from Super Metroid to mind. The Noob Bridge is a bridge at the bottom of (Green) Brinstar where the game locks you in until you figure out that you need to hold the run-button to make it across. You start the game with that ability and may have already used it unknowingly, or read the manual. The game locks you in by literally closing the one-way door behind you until you figure out what you have to do. While effective, it's quite a frustrating way to lock the player down.



_The “Tutorial”_

One thing that you shouldn’t forget is to show the player how to use the key they find. This leans back into the anticipation angle. You’ve showed them a scenario they cannot beat yet, then you give them a new toy, after that you give them a relatively safe environment in which they can try their new toy. Then the player will remember the scenario you showed them first, generating that a-ha moment.

To showcase the design of the depths of Xoth VI, the player will be given a small section that has the three above points clearly designated. They will be given a goal to accomplish, like getting to the other side of a chasm, the means to cross that chasm, hidden in a smaller area they have to find, and a small playground to let the player familiarize themselves with the tool they are going to use.

The player is lead to an area with a fork in the road. Straight ahead leads to the Chasm. This is the point of anticipation. They can see their goal on the other side of the Chasm, but they don’t have the means to cross yet. They can go down a level and see some water that needs to be raised, and a sluice that can be opened from somewhere else.\
When they go back and take a side route, they see an area with more water and floating crates. The water level can change by opening and closing valves on the side. The floating crates can form a path to the next goal: The Ice Beam. This Ice Beam can be seen from the entrance to this room. This creates another point of anticipation.\
Now they have the Ice Beam, they can try it out in the room they found it in. Here they also find the controls to the sluice at the Chasm.\
They make their way back to the Chasm, and now they have the Ice Beam, they can create a path across the Chasm and reach the Exit.
