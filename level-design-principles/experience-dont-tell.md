# Experience, don't tell

When you want the player to learn a skill, they need to practice.&#x20;



To let the player focus on learning a new skill,  you can lock them into a small part of your level.

The latter brings the infamous “Noob Bridge” from Super Metroid to mind. The Noob Bridge is a bridge at the bottom of Brinstar (Green Hill Zone, for the speedrunners among us) where the game locks you in until you figure out that you need to hold the run-button to make it across. You start the game with that ability and may have already used it unknowingly, or read the manual. The game locks you in by literally closing the one-way door behind you until you figure out what you have to do. While effective, it's quite a frustrating way to lock the player down.
