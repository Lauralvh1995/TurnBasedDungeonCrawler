# Lock-And-Key Principle

The Lock-And-Key Principle is a way to design a level. You present a lock to the player, and they then go in another direction to find the correct key. This does not need to be a literal lock or key, but you do you.

When the player is confronted with a metaphorical lock, they will need to find the corresponding key to progress. This key can be an item, a tool, a literal key, or even knowledge about the game’s systems. 



The latter brings the infamous “Noob Bridge” from Super Metroid to mind. The Noob Bridge is a bridge at the bottom of Brinstar (Green Hill Zone, for the speedrunners among us) where the game locks you in until you figure out that you need to hold the run-button to make it across. You start the game with that ability and may have already used it unknowingly, or read the manual. The game locks you in by literally closing the one-way door behind you until you figure out what you have to do. While effective, it's quite a frustrating way to lock the player down.
