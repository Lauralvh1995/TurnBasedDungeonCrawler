# Lock-And-Key

The Lock-And-Key Principle is a way to design a level. You present a lock to the player, and they then go in another direction to find the correct key. This does not need to be a literal lock or key, but you do you.

When the player is confronted with a metaphorical lock, they will need to find the corresponding key to progress. This key can be an item, a tool, a literal key, knowledge, or the level layout itself.

Boss Keys, a series by Game Maker's Toolkit, goes in-depth on the level designs of the The Legend of Zelda series, explaining how the dungeons are set up, and later expands to the Metroid series, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Hollow Knight and Dark Souls, as their level designs all share various aspects. I have taken this Lock-And-Key principle from them.
