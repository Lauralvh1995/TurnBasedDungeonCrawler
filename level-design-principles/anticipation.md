# Anticipation

Anticipation is a term taken from Animation. It's a wind-up before an action, which you use to add weight to said actions. You want to inform the player that something is going to happen. An action without weight, without context, is meaningless. And without meaning, the player will not have any investment.

To create the desire to explore the world, you can present a carrot to the player. A treasure, a vantage point, this big bad enemy. This dangling carrot is one the player cannot reach yet, but will in the future. Over the course, you build weight to the moment when the player reaches that carrot. 

Or you give them a save point, or a big health pack. This builds the anticipation that something big is about to happen. The game wouldn't give you extra resources if it doesn't expect you to use them soon after, right?
